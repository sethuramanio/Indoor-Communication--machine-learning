# Indoor Intelligent Communication--machine-learning

This repository consists of the MATLAB code that we used to detect the points of attention in an indoor environment to channelize( Beam form) Li-Fi accordingly. The algorithm used for the same is attached in the same repo. 

This algorithm tracks the mobility pattern of the user over a period of time and calculates the points the points that need the maximum attanetion. 
To accomodate the Li-Fi infrastructure , the algorithm uses a simple convolution operation to get the desired intensity output.
